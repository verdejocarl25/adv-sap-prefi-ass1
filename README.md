## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
Based on my research, Service-Oriented Architecture acts like a connector or an adapter to a business in which it connects services that instead of recreating or reusing some service over different systems, combine services to serve much more complex tasks. It is a bundle of services that is reusable and interactive which makes them to be easily incorporated into new systems.


2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
STANDARDIZED SERVICE CONTRACTS

As the names suggest in this characteristic, it handles the service used for, it describes its purpose, and capabilities, and uses regulated service contracts.
LOOSE COUPLING

Loose Coupling creates a more connected place between elements, so if there is a change the other services will be notified or changed, to reduce dependencies between service aspects.
ABSTRACTION

It hides the service from the outside world by encapsulating the information that is related to the service and prevents unnecessary data from being abundant in the service and it plays a critical role in service composition.
SERVICE REUSABILITY

As the name suggests this characteristic is you the service to be highly reusable in different circumstances.
AUTONOMY

It is also expected that the service is automated means there is no need for outside intervention, the system must handle minor things to increase its reliability and predictability.
STATELESSNESS

The service must be scalable which means it can be used in the future or be upgraded, so if there is a need to reduce or add a new feature it will not cause any anomalies that would cause trouble.
DISCOVERABILITY

As a service, it must include a discovery method for its service registry to find appropriate metadata much more efficiently and easily.
COMPOSABILITY

The service must divide complex and large problems into smaller parts to alleviate its maintenance, it is also expected that the service is flexible and highly tuned to allow different functions to meet its requirements.
INTEROPERABILITY

The service should follow standard regulations to allow a wide range of subscribers to be able to use the service.

3. Define Microservices.
It is similar to the Service Oriented Architecture, in which it offers the same characteristics like being reusable and a collection of services however its target is not the large-scale enterprises but small businesses and organizations, microservice provides a much agile, scalable, and resilient service for individual application uses.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
The benefit of using microservices is their deployability they can be deployed with fewer efforts compared to a much larger scaled service that takes time to implement small changes, it is also beneficial to employees since with a small code they can understand it much easier and faster requiring a little effort, aside from that microservices is highly modifiable and can be sculpted to a specific use, not only that microservice also offer cloud-based services which make data to be accessible anywhere.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences between SOA and Microservices.
Both Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices offer the same thing they both offer a much easier and more reliable function to an organization with their reusability, scaling, and compatibility features it feels a requirement to have one since it enables efficient use of resources and time, and their only difference is the target appropriateness in use Service Oriented Architecture will prove best for large-scale enterprises that have a lot of resources in terms of manpower and margin as for the Microservices as the name suggests it is for a much smaller organization with fewer resource however due to its size it is proven to be more agile, and easy to handle with it being modified to a specific use.
